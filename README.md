# basis

The simplest reasonable web server for TypeScript

## Why?

It's annoying to work with `node:http` on every project. It's also often the case that I don't want a full fledged framework with routers and all sorts of other details. Basis is an attempt at a toolkit for handling the base http layer for other toolkits.
